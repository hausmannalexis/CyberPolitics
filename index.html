                <h3>Iran's Military Capabilities and Strategic Developments: A Comprehensive Analysis</h3>
                <p>For approximately 45 years the islamic revolution in the islamic republic of Iran not only held onto power but also further spurred the developement of their shia revolution in their region. With countless financial regulations, arms embargoes and adversaries that have attempted in hindering them in becoming a regional powerhouse in the wider arabian region. Nowadays, everybody knows of and about the huge influence the Iranian regime has not only in the middle eastern region but also with the shia population and emigrated Iranians wordlwide. Achieving this could not have been and probably still is a hard task for a regime trying to make sure the revolution gets preserved, therefore Iran invested heavily in assymetric warfare such as drones, missiles and cyber attacks whilst forming strategic partnerships with likeminded allies such as Lybia, North Korea or Russia. Another angle the Iranians took early on was the support of regional militas in other Arab countries such as the Hamas in Palestine, the Hisbollah in Lebanon, Iraqi Militas in Iraq and the Houthis/Ansar Allah in Yemen giving them powerfull instruments otherwise called proxies that can be used in their geopolitical games and charades.</p>
