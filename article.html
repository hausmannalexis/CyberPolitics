      <h2>Former UK soldier accused of helping Iran tells jurors he is against Tehran</h2>
      <p>LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - A British soldier accused of passing sensitive information to people linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and of then breaking out of prison told jurors on Wednesday that he and his family were opposed to the Iranian government.
Daniel Abed Khalife allegedly collected sensitive information between May 2019 and January 2022, prosecutor Mark Heywood told jurors at the start of the trial at London's Woolwich Crown Court.
Khalife, who is no longer a member of the British armed forces, is also accused of leaving a fake bomb on a desk and absconding from his barracks in 2023, and then escaping from prison, sparking a brief nationwide manhunt.
The 23-year-old is standing trial charged with gathering information that might be useful to an enemy, namely Iran â€“ an offence under the Official Secrets Act.
Khalife has denied all the charges.
Prosecutors say Khalife picked up around 1,500 pounds ($2,000) in 2019 on instructions from his handler and anonymously emailed Britain's MI6 foreign intelligence service two weeks later, saying he wanted "to work as a double agent".</p>
