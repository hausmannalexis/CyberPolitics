      <h2>Iran's Military Capabilities and Strategic Developments: A Comprehensive Analysis</h2>

      <p>For approximately 45 years the islamic revolution in the islamic republic of Iran not only held onto power but also further spurred the developement of their shia revolution in their region. With countless financial regulations, arms embargoes and 
        adversaries that have attempted in hindering them in becoming a regional powerhouse in the wider arabian region. Nowadays, everybody knows of and about the huge influence the Iranian regime has not only in the middle eastern region but also with 
        the shia population and emigrated Iranians wordlwide. Achieving this could not have been and probably still is a hard task for a regime trying to make sure the revolution gets preserved, therefore Iran invested heavily in 
        assymetric warfare such as drones, missiles and cyber attacks whilst forming strategic partnerships with likeminded allies such as Lybia, North Korea or Russia. Another angle the Iranians took early on was the 
        support of regional militas in other Arab countries such as the Hamas in Palestine, the Hisbollah in Lebanon, Iraqi Militas in Iraq and the Houthis/Ansar Allah in Yemen giving them powerfull instruments otherwise called proxies that can be used in their geopolitical
        games and charades. </p>

      <h3 id="executivesummary">Executive Summary</h3>
      
        <p>The Islamic Republic of Iran has many ways to combat its foes, from long-range balistic missiles with a range of up to 2'0000 kilometer able to hit Crete from Teheran, 
            drones for reconnaisance and active strike missions and sophisticated cyber attacks allowing the regime to reach anyone or anything around the globe.</p>

        <p>After the fall of the Shah in the year 1979 the newborn islamic republic was left with a decent military industrial complex allowing for them to maintain and start 
            reverse engineerering equipment that was either imported or looted during multiple conflicts. First success was the Toophan Anti Tank Guided Missile 
            (https://www.armyrecognition.com/focus-analysis-conflicts/army/defence-security-industry-technology/iranian-toofan-laser-guided-anti-tank-missile-production-line-displayed) 
            which was first deployed in 1988 and is clearly a reconstruction of the American BMG-71 TOW missile (http://www.army-guide.com/eng/product367.html). Throughout the years the 
            Iranian military industry has only become better and better at reverse engineering equipment of all kinds and sorts. This includes the Sentinel Drone, the Javelin, 
            Isreali Spike Missiles and all kinds of missiles for example the SCUD-B.</p>

            <p>Eventually the country formed strategic alliances with other "rogue" nations around the world at the time such as Lybia and/or North
                Korea. In 1984 and 1985, Iran received their first 8 SCUD-B missiles, with a range of 300 km, then a year later 20 more and in 1987 
                they received 120 SCUD-B missiles from a purchase by North Korea marking the beginning of the missile age for Iran. Relationships like these only 
                further increase the military capabilities and assymetric warfare options due to strict restrictions on arms trade with Iran, which forces them to align 
                with other "rogue" nations exchanging amrs, technology and more. Since the start of the Ukraine-Russia War it has been confirmed that the Russian regime sends 
                captured western equipment to the Iranian regime for reverse engineering and furthering their military industry.</p>

            <p>Another investment that Iran started early and is paying off heavily are drones, during the Iraq-Iran war the Iranians already developed and produced a simple drone 
                called the Mohajer-1 (https://military-history.fandom.com/wiki/Qods_Mohajer) with a still camera allowing for photographs to be taken. The drone program took off after 
                Iran had sucessfully reconstructed their own versions of the RQ-170 Sentinel Drone and the ScanEagle resulting in the Shahed-171 Simorgh and Yasir. Famously, 
                the Iranians are exporting huge amounts of Shahed Suicide drones to Russia to aid them in their war on Ukraine. This strategic alliance between the two countries 
                not only strengthens the other but also gives Iran for example a trove of data on their weapon systems etc. similar to how the North Koreans are sending 
                ballistic missile to Russia for test data from a real life war.</p>
