      <h2>Iran's Military Capabilities and Strategic Developments: A Comprehensive Analysis</h2>

      <img src="Pictures/iranaf.jpg">

      <p>For approximately 45 years the islamic revolution in the islamic republic of Iran not only held onto power but also further spurred the developement of their shia revolution in their region. With countless financial regulations, arms embargoes and 
        adversaries that have attempted in hindering them in becoming a regional powerhouse in the wider arabian region. Nowadays, everybody knows of and about the huge influence the Iranian regime has not only in the middle eastern region but also with 
        the shia population and emigrated Iranians wordlwide. Achieving this could not have been and probably still is a hard task for a regime trying to make sure the revolution gets preserved, therefore Iran invested heavily in 
        assymetric warfare such as drones, missiles and cyber attacks whilst forming strategic partnerships with likeminded allies such as Lybia, North Korea or Russia. Another angle the Iranians took early on was the 
        support of regional militas in other Arab countries such as the Hamas in Palestine, the Hisbollah in Lebanon, Iraqi Militas in Iraq and the Houthis/Ansar Allah in Yemen giving them powerfull instruments otherwise called proxies that can be used in their geopolitical
        games and charades. </p>

      <h3 id="executivesummary">Executive Summary</h3>
      
        <p>The Islamic Republic of Iran has developed many ways to combat its foes over the time of 45 years since the revolution in 1979, from acquiring and reverse engineering long-range balistic missiles with a range of up to 2'0000 kilometer that would able to hit for example Crete from Teheran, drones suited for both reconnaisance and active strike missions and an army of hackers and it personnel for sophisticated cyber attacks enabling the regime to reach anyone or anything around the globe.</p>

        <p>After the fall of the Shah during the revolution in the year 1979 the newborn Islamic Republic of Iran was left with an already established military industrial complex allowing for the regime to maintain and start reverse engineerering equipment, which was sourced either from allies like Lybia, China, North Korea and Syria or salvaged in the Iraq-Iran war, almost immediately from the beginning. The first big success was the construction of the Toophan Anti Tank Guided Missile (1) which was first deployed in 1988 and is clearly a reconstruction of the American BMG-71 TOW missile (2) which had been provided through the so called Iran-Contra affair which saw the United States of America sell TOW missiles to Iran from 1985 to 1987 disregarding the arms embargo imposed by the international community. Throughout the years the Iranian military industry has only become more proficient at reverse engineering equipment of all differemt kinds and sorts. This includes the RQ-170 Sentinel Drone, the US Javelin, Isreali Spike Missiles and all kinds of missiles for example the SCUD-B and SCUD-C.</p>

        <p>Eventually the country formed strategic alliances with other "rogue" nations around the world at the time such as Lybia and/or North Korea. In 1984 and 1985, Iran received their first 8 SCUD-B missiles from an agreement reached with Gadaffi and Lybia, with a meagre range of only 300 km, then eventually a year later Iran received 20 more missiles and then in 1987 they purchased 120 SCUD-B missiles from North Korea marking the beginning of the missile age in Iran. Relationships like these only further increase the military capabilities and assymetric warfare options due to strict restrictions on arms trade with Iran, which forces them to align with other "rogue" nations exchanging amrs, technology and more. Since the start of the Ukraine-Russia War it has been shown that the Russian military forces send, in Ukraine, captured western equipment to the Iranian regime for their engineers to reverse engineer and eventually produce domestically further adding to the self-suffiency and reliability of the Islamic Republic of Iran Armed Forces. To come full circle and create a symbiosis is that as a return the Iranian government provided a lot of Shahed-136 drones, or Shahed suicide drones, to the Russians further improving their capabilities to figth the Ukrainians. This in return further gives the Iranian engineers more test data from real life scenearios allowing them too tweak and improve on their drone platforms.</p>

        <p>Another investment that Iran started early and is paying off heavily are drones, during the Iraq-Iran war the Iranians already developed and produced a simple drone called the Mohajer-1 (3) with a still camera allowing for photographs to be taken. The drone program took off after Iran had sucessfully reconstructed their own versions of the RQ-170 Sentinel Drone and the ScanEagle resulting in the Shahed-171 Simorgh and Yasir.</p>
